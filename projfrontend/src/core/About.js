      <p>
        At Bolt, we believe style shouldn't demand a huge investment
        of time or money. Style should be comfortable, accessible and easy to
        achieve. That's why our footwear feels as good as it looks, effortlessly
        taking you from the boardroom to the restaurant, to the park with your
        family. We strive to ensure your shopping experience is easy on your
        wallet, and your schedule, by delivering fashion and value to everyone
        in your household.
